        <h2>Children Welcome</h2>
        <p>We are delighted to have children join us in celebrating our wedding! Little ones are welcome at both the ceremony and reception. We understand that children may need to move around or make some noise, and that's perfectly fine with us. We want all our loved ones, including the youngest ones, to be part of this special day.</p>

        <h2>Holy Communion</h2>
        <p>During the Mass, we will celebrate Holy Communion. In accordance with Catholic teaching, Holy Communion is reserved for Catholics who are in a state of grace and have received their First Holy Communion. If you are not Catholic or are not able to receive Communion, we invite you to remain in your seat during the distribution of Communion, or you may come forward with your arms crossed over your chest to receive a blessing from the priest. We are grateful for your presence and participation in our celebration, regardless of whether you receive Communion.</p>
