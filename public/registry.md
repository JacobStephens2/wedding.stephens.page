# Overview
On the registry page should be registry functionality. We should be able to have a way to add links to add to the registry on the the registry page.

# Adding Registry Items
There should be a file in the private directory in which we can add links to registry items, perhaps a JSON file which we can modify to add items to the registry.

Alternatively there could be a private, password protected admin page which we could use to add registry items. This page could store registry items in the MySQL database upon entry

# Ability for Users to Mark Registry Items as Purchased
Site visitors should be able to mark registry items as purchased so that other visitors can know what has and has not been purchased.
