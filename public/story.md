The font for paragraphs on the story page should be upper-lower case, not fully uppercase. Ensure the font is not fully uppercase only.

# Clicking through photos
When a photo has been clicked and is up in its detail view, the user should be able to move through the photos by clicking the arrow keys on their keyboard, and they should be able to close the detail photo view by clicking the escape key on their keyboard.

Users viewing the photo detail view on mobile should be able to swipe side to side to change the photo they are viewing.
